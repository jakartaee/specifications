Model-View-Controller, or MVC for short, is a common pattern in Web frameworks where it is used predominantly to build HTML applications. The model refers to the application’s data, the view to the application’s data presentation and the controller to the part of the system responsible for managing input, updating models and producing output.

Web UI frameworks can be categorized as action-based or component-based. In an action-based framework, HTTP requests are routed to controllers where they are turned into actions by application code; in a component-based framework, HTTP requests are grouped and typically handled by framework components with little or no interaction from application code. In other words, in a component-based framework, the majority of the controller logic is provided by the framework instead of the application.
