title: "Jakarta Annotations 2.1 (under development)"
date: 2021-10-20
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 10"
---
Jakarta Annotations defines a collection of annotations representing common semantic concepts that enable a declarative style of programming that applies across a variety of Java technologies.

The goal of this release is to provide features requested by the community, such as:

* Allow @Priority to be used everywhere [Issue #86](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/common-annotations-api/issues/86)
* Add @Nullable and @NotNull annotations [Issue #89](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/common-annotations-api/issues/89)

The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 10.

The release won't contain any backwards incompatible changes.
