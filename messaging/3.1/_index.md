title: "Jakarta Messaging 3.1 (Under Development)"
date: 2021-05-19
summary: "Jakarta EE 10 Release"
---

Jakarta Messaging describes a means for Java applications to create, send, and receive messages via loosely coupled, reliable asynchronous communication services.

# Plan
Jakarta Messaging 3.1 will target the Jakarta EE 10 platform release. 

Jakarta Messaging 3.1 will be a minor update with fixes and enhancements. 

It will contain:

* Bug fixes as they arise during the release cycle
* Small enhancements to take advantage of some newer Java features in the lowest supported Java version (for example repeatable annotations)
* A standalone TCK separated from the Jakarta EE TCK so that it's easier to certify standalone implementations of Jakarta Messaging
* Documentation clean up as identified during the release cycle
* Any updates required to meet the Java version requirements of Jakarta EE 10
* Any requirements identified by other specifications or the Jakarta EE 10 platform projects during the release cycle.
