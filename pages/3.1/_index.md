Jakarta Server Pages defines a template engine for web applications that supports mixing of textual content
(including HTML and XML) with custom tags, expression language, and embedded Java code, that gets compiled
into a Jakarta Servlet.

scripting variables associated with custom actions
* [44](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsp-api/issues/44) Clarify that the EL environment within a JSP has a
set of default imports consistent with the default imports for the scripting environment. Refactor
the ScopedAttributeELResolver to remove the special handling for imports and unresolved
variables
