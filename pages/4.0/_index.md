title: "Jakarta Pages 4.0 (under development)"
date: 2023-05-22
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 11"
---
Jakarta Pages defines a template engine for web applications that supports mixing of textual content
(including HTML and XML) with custom tags, expression language, and embedded Java code, that gets compiled
into a Jakarta Servlet.

This release removes deprecated code and provides any additional updates necessary to align with changes in the Jakarta Servlet and/or Expression Language specifications.

### New features, enhancements or additions
* Updated ErrorData to add support for the new attribute jakarta.servlet.error.query_string

### Removals, deprecations or backwards incompatible changes
* All code deprecated as of Jakarta Server Pages 3.1 has been removed. Specifically:
  * Remove methods that override ELResolver.getFeatureDescriptors() as that method will be removed as of EL 6.0
  * Remove the isThreadSafe page directive attribute as the related Servlet API interface SingleThreadModel has been removed as of the Servlet 6.0 specification
  * Remove the jsp:plugin action and related actions as the associated HTML elements are no longer supported by any major browser

### Minimum Java SE Version
**Java SE 11 or higher**
