## Specification Service Release PR template
When creating a service release, create PRs with the content defined as follows.

Include the following in the PR:
- [ ] The URL of the Eclipse Project release record:
      <add URL here>
- [ ] The URL of the OSSRH staging repository for the api, javadoc:
      <add URL here>
- [ ] The URL of the staging directory on downloads.eclipse.org for the proposed EFTL TCK binary:
      <add URL here>
- [ ] The URL of the compatibility certification request (CCR) issue:
      <add URL here>
- [ ] Specification JavaDoc in the `wombat/x.y/apidocs` directory.
- [ ] Changelog file at this location describing service release updates, `wombat/x.y/changelog`.
- [ ] Update `wombat/x.y/_index.md` accordingly.
- [ ] Start service release review by emailing [Specification Committee](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jakarta.ee-spec) and referencing this PR.

Note: Specifications themselves do not have service releases.  Only the associated API (limited to JavaDoc updates), JavaDoc, and TCK artifacts can have service releases.  Thus, the Specification version does not use the third digit -- only the `x.y` version is used in the Specification directory structure.
 
Note: If any item does not apply, check it and mark N/A below it.
