- Add operation to obtain the number of query results
- Add an annotation to exclude a field from optimistic locking
- Allow `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery` more control over query execution
- Allow passing an `EntityGraph` to `refresh()`, and improve usability of entity graphs
- Make `select new` implicit when a query result type is given
- Add a `@PreMerge` lifecycle callback
- Add support for `SequencedCollection` and friends
- Decouple entity discovery/enhancement from `EntityManagerFactory` initialization in container environments
- Specify that the `jakarta.persistence.database-xxxx` configuration properties are available for use by the application program, and not only by containers

- Change return type of `createNativeQuery()` to `TypedQuery`
- Drop use of `SecurityManager`
- Clarify the format of entity names
