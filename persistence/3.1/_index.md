summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 10"
---
Jakarta Persistence defines a standard for management of persistence
and object/relational mapping in Java(R) environments.

The goal of this release is to:

* provide features requested by the community (for example [#77](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jpa-api/issues/77))
* implement requirements by other specification included in Jakarta EE 10
* editorial updates and clarifications in the specification (for example [#307](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jpa-api/issues/307), [#308](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jpa-api/issues/308))

The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 10.
