The Jakarta EE Core Profile defines a profile of the Jakarta EE platform specifically targeted at smaller runtimes.

1. To provide a profile that contains a set of Jakarta EE Specifications targeting smaller runtimes suitable for microservices and ahead-of-time compilation.
2. The TCK(s) for the Core profile should be possible to run independently of the Full Platform TCK.
3. Java SE version will be aligned with the Platform Project's decision regarding Java SE versions.
