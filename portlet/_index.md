Jakarta Portlet enables the development of modular, reusable web components called portlets. These components are managed by a well-defined lifecycle (implemented by a portlet container) that includes action, render, event, and resource phases. A portal uses a portlet container implementation to host and coordinate portlets, assembling their output fragments into a unified, composite application interface. Portlets render markup fragments that are aggregated by the portal, typically as a complete HTML document.
