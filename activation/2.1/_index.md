title: "Jakarta Activation 2.1 (under development)"
date: 2021-04-15
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 10"
---

Jakarta Activation defines a set of standard services to: determine the
MIME type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to it;
discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the
appropriate bean to perform the operation(s).

The goal of this release is to provide standalone API jar fully independent
on the particular implementation.

The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 10.
