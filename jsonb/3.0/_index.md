Jakarta JSON Binding defines a binding framework for converting Java(R) objects to and from JSON documents.

The goal of this release is to provide features requested by the community, such as:

* Deserialization of the null to the JsonValue.NULL_VALUE - [JSON-B API #181](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api/issues/181)
* @JsonbTypeDeserializer and @JsonbTypeAdapter supported as a parameter/type annotation - [JSON-B API #71](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api/issues/71)
* Support for handling polymorphic types - [JSON-B API #147](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api/issues/147)
* Deprecate @JsonbProperty.nillable() - [JSON-B API #52](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api/issues/52)

Including the following backwards incompatible changes:

* Optional @JsonbCreator parameters - [JSON-B API #121](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jsonb-api/issues/121)

The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 10.

* [Jakarta JSON Binding 3.0 Release Record](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsonb/releases/3.0.0)
