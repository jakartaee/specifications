Jakarta Portlet Bridge defines the behavior and APIs necessary for Jakarta Faces applications to operate within a portlet environment. It provides a bridge that aligns the Jakarta Faces lifecycle with the Jakarta Portlet lifecycle. This enables developers to use features such as declarative Facelet views, navigation-rules, and component suites while maintaining compatibility with the multi-phase request and response model defined by portlet containers.
