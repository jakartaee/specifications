title: "Jakarta Data 1.1 (under development)"
date: 2025-01-28
summary: "Enhancements for Jakarta EE 12"
---

Jakarta Data simplifies data access by allowing you to represent data with simple Java objects (entities), and define interfaces (repositories) with methods that perform operations on it.

### New features, enhancements or additions

* [Ability to define query restrictions dynamically](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/829)
* [Life cycle events](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/373)
* [Bring parameter based automatic query methods up to the level of what Query by Method Name can do for static queries](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/857)
* [Query Fragments](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/546)
* [Multiple item select lists/DTOs/Entity Views](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/539)
* [Consider additional annotations related to Jakarta Persistence](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/470)
* [Reactive patterns](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/17) and [integration with Jakarta Concurrency Asynchronous](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/19)
* Move Jakarta Data Query Language to Jakarta Query specification (if accepted and included in Jakarta EE 12) where it will remain fully compatible.
* Configuration via Jakarta Config (if Jakarta Config is released and makes it into Jakarta EE 12 in time)
* [Explicitly state where NoSQL databases can raise errors for function the database type is not capable of](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/issues/782)
* TCK refactoring and enhancements to more logically split out tests that are targeted at various levels of database support (key-value, column, document, graph, relational).


### Removals, deprecations or backwards incompatible changes

* Consider deprecating an [impl package](https://github.com/jakartaee/data/tree/main/api/src/main/java/jakarta/data/metamodel/impl) that should not have been made available in the API.

### Minimum Java SE Version
<!-- Specify the minimum required Java SE version for this specification -->
* **Java SE 21 or higher**
