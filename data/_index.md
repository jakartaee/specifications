The Jakarta Data specification provides an API for easier data access. A Java developer can split the persistence from the model with several features, such as the ability to compose custom query methods on a Repository interface.

Jakarta Dataâ€™s goal is to provide a familiar and consistent, Jakarta-based programming model for data access while still retaining the particular traits of the underlying data store.
