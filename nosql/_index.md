Jakarta NoSQL is a standalone Specification with a future goal of becoming part of the Jakarta EE 10 platform.

Jakarta NoSQL is a Java API standard that streamlines the integration of Java applications with NoSQL databases. It defines a set of APIs and provides a standard implementation for most NoSQL databases. 
The goal is to create the specification in Jakarta EE to help Jakarta EE developers create enterprise-grade applications using JavaÂ® and NoSQL technologies. It helps them create scalable applications while maintaining low coupling with the underlying NoSQL technology.
