title: "Jakarta Authorization 3.0"
date: 2024-04-30
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 11"
---
Jakarta Authorization defines a low-level SPI for authorization modules, which are repositories of permissions
facilitating subject based security by determining whether a given subject has a given permission, and algorithms
to transform security constraints for specific containers (such as Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans) into
these permissions.

The primary goal of this release is to make Jakarta Authorization future proof by adding a replacement for the Policy and generally the removal of security manager. Also make it more suitable for cloud deployments, by adding an option to add policy providers programmatically for a single application. This mirrors the API available for Jakarta Authentication.


### New features, enhancements or additions
* Register a policy provider programmatically per application [AUTHORIZATION #98](https://github.com/jakartaee/authorization/issues/98)
* Standarize the context ID for Servlet containers
* Several convenience methods to make the API easier to use

### Removals, deprecations or backwards incompatible changes
* Design and implement replacement for Policy [AUTHORIZATION #99](https://github.com/jakartaee/authorization/issues/99)
* Remove references to the SecurityManager

### Minimum Java SE Version
**Java SE 17 or higher**
