summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 12"

Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides a foundational API to develop web services following the 
Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.

The goal of this release is to continue the path towards full integration with CDI whilst 
maintaining compatibility with previous releases. A few annotations and types may be 
deprecated and marked for removal in preparation for future work.
