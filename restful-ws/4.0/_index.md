title: "Jakarta RESTful Web Services 4.0"
date: 2021-04-15
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 10"
---
Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides a foundational API to develop web services following the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.

The goal of this release is to provide better alignment between Jakarta RESTful Web Services and 
Jakarta Contexts Dependency Injection (CDI). This will be the first backward incompatible release of 
Jakarta REST.  

* Drop support for @Context injection and related artifacts
* Define CDI scopes for all Jakarta REST types
* Define CDI integration and startup for Java SE applications
* Enhance discovery of application artifacts using CDI scanning 
* Review integration with legacy Jakarta EE specifications (e.g., EJB)
* Explore integration with Jakarta Concurrency 

The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 10.
