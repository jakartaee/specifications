title: "Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1 (under development)"
date: 2021-04-15
summary: "Independent Release"
---
Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides a foundational API to develop web services following the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern.

The goal of this release is to provide an update of the API with some recently requested features while maintaining 
backward compatibility with earlier releases. Note that this release is not being proposed for inclusion in
Jakarta 9.1 but should be compatible with it. 

Summary of changes:

* Java SE Bootstrap API - [Issue #509](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/509)
* Support for multipart media type - [Issue #418](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/418)
* Better alignment with JSON-B - [Issue #742](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/742)
* Automatic loading of provider extensions - [Issue #751](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/issues/751)
* Deprecation of `@Context` in preparation for better alignment with CDI
    
The JDK version required will be aligned with Jakarta EE 9.1. The latest details and progress for this work 
may be found on the [Project Site](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxrs) as well as the
[Github Wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxrs-api/wiki).
