Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are one of the most prominent developments in enterprise and cloud native computing in decades. They promise to fundamentally accelerate innovation, automation, and productivity by leveraging AI in virtually every industry â€“ IT, finance, banking, retail, manufacturing, health care, and so many others. Agents operate by leveraging Neural Networks, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and many other AI technologies to aim to perform specific tasks autonomously with little or no human intervention. They detect events, gather data, generate self-correcting plans, execute actions, process results, and evolve subsequent decisions. Examples include self-driving cars, security monitors, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) agents, stock monitors, code/application generators, health monitors, customer service agents, manufacturing robots, and many others.

The Jakarta Agentic AI project provides a set of vendor-neutral APIs that make it easy and reliable to build, deploy, and run AI agents on Jakarta EE runtimes.
