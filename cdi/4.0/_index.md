The Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 4.0 goals for this release are:

* Split the existing 3.0 specification into pieces that separate out requirements based on the target runtime container support; Java SE, Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Message Service, etc.
* Breakup the TCK to separate out the concers along the lines of the target runtime requirements as outlined in 1.
* Introduce a new CDI-lite specification that targets supporting build time compliation of applications.
* Java SE version will be aligned with the Core profile requirements regarding Java SE versions.
* Consider addressing open issues:
    * [Executable methods](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi/issues/460)
    * [Removal of deprecated bits](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi/issues/472)
    * [Improve constructor injection](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi/issues/464)
    * [AFTER_SUCCESS Observers and Events fired from within EntityListeners](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi/issues/467)
    * [Add methods to BeanConfigurator for applying decorators](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi/issues/459)
