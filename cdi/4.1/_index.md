title: "Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 4.1 (Under development)"
date: 2023-11-30
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 11"
---

Jakarta Contexts Dependency Injection specifies a means for obtaining objects in such a way as to maximize reusability, testability and maintainability compared to traditional approaches such as constructors, factories, and service locators (e.g., JNDI).

### New features, enhancements or additions
<!-- List here -->
Several minor issues in the Specification, APIs and TCK will be addresses as detailed in the [CDI 4.1 Milestone](https://github.com/jakartaee/cdi/milestone/1)
The overview of currently suggested topics includes:
* Breaking up spec/TCK to remove circular dependencies
* Delegate integration requirements to the Jakarta Platform specifications
* Method invokers
* Executable methods
* Getting interceptor bindings in standard way
* @Priority on producers
* Review unused imports in classes in CDI 4
* How can getReference() legally be invoked during AfterDeploymentValidation event if contexts have not been created
* Programmatic access to Assignability rules
* Add methods to BeanConfigurator for applying decorators
* List of potential changes/features for next CDI version
* Improve wording of managed bean requirements WRT non-static public fields
* Inconsistent behavior when finding unproxyable bean
( possibly remove the references to the Managed Beans specification
* possible rename of Jakarta Bean Validation to Jakarta Validation
* Assignability of raw and parameterized types for type variables with multiple bounds (CDI-440) spec-clarificationAn issue requesting clarification in the specification

### Removals, deprecations or backwards incompatible changes
<!-- List here -->
* The Expression Language SPI methods on the BeanManager will be deprecated in preparation for a move to a new subinterface
that will be part of a new artifact. This removes the dependency on the Jakarta Expression Language from core API,
and refactors features that are not client facing into the subinterface.

### Minimum Java SE Version
<!-- Specify the minimum required Java SE version for this specification -->
**Java SE 21 or higher**
